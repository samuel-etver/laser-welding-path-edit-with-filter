# laser-welding-path-edit-with-filter

Editor of the Y,Z-coordinates of the path for the laser welding machine for large diameter pipes.

## Overview
Using the program, the Y,Z-coordinates of the scanned pipe track are read from the Simatic S-300 controller.
Values can be changed either in the table or on the chart by dragging points.
Point status (valid/not valid) can be changed in the table.
The corrected path(or filtered path) is written back to the controller.
The path can be saved/loaded in csv or xml-format.<br>
